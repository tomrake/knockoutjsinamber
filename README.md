=================

This serves as an example of how a Javascript library can be used in Amber http://www.amber-lang.org/.
By showing how I thought about and used Amber to make this conversion I want to inspire you to convert other Javascript libararies for use in Amber.

The amber knockoutjs implementation is __not the main point__ of this repository.
