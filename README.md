knockjsoutinamber
=================

This serves as an example of how a Javascript library can be used in Amber http://www.amber-lang.org/.
By showing how I thought about and used Amber to make this conversion I want to inspire you to convert other Javascript libararies for use in Amber.

The amber knoeckoutjs implementation is not the main point of this repository.

The goal here is to present the conversion of knockoutjs to an Amber extension tp SHOW YOU my thought process
